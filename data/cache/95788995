Striking Fear From the Second Tier - WSJ.com 
 By GABRIELE MARCOTTI     In the space of a few hours Saturday night, European soccer registered two massive upsets, the kind that call into question conventional wisdom about the gap between rich and poor. Barcelona is the defending champion of La Liga and boasts the backbone of Spain's World Cup-winning team, plus Lionel Messi, arguably the best player in the world. It was hosting H&#233;rcules, a club from the port of Alicante making its return to the top flight after 13 years in the wilderness. And Saturday was Diada Nacional de Catalunya, the Catalan equivalent of the Fourth of July, when nationalism and local pride rise sky-high.

The fact that Mr. Ibrahimovic's salary of $19 million is more than the entire Cesena squad put together tells you all you need to know about the disparity of resources on display. Yet on that day, both Milan and Barcelona went down by identical 2-0 scorelines. What's interesting&#8212;apart from the eternal truth that, beyond pedigree, resources and star power you still have to actually play the games and beat your opponent&#8212;is that both H&#233;rcules and Cesena retooled heavily and on the cheap over the summer. "We have a good squad with many new players [this summer]," said Luigi Piangerelli, the Cesena midfielder. "We face a big test, but we have a lot of willingness to do well on our return to Serie A." Promotion to the top flight presents something of a dilemma. The gap between the top two tiers is so large that logic suggests investing to strengthen the squad. Yet doing so can backfire badly, partly because it takes time to build chemistry (and in any case you're always reluctant to break up a team that functions well, albeit in the second tier). Plus, should you get relegated, you'll be saddled with hefty contracts and debt. While revenues for promoted clubs obviously increase, costs generally increase at a much higher rate. That's why European football is littered with "fallen giants" who overspent in an effort to stay in the top flight and, as a result, flirted with bankruptcy or slipped down through the divisions. With limited transfer budgets and the knowledge that mistakes can be deadly, newly-promoted clubs basically have one shot to get it right. This is especially true for teams like H&#233;rcules and Cesena whose "natural" level is probably the second tier, unlike so-called yo-yo clubs, which regularly move up and down between the top two divisions. So both had to rely on ingenuity and creativity to bolster their squads. H&#233;rcules spent around $7 million in the summer. Against Barcelona, newcomers comprised six of the starting 11. More than half the budget went on securing the Paraguayan striker Nelson Haedo Valdez, who scored both goals. Mr. Valdez spent much of his career in Germany's Bundesliga, most recently as an occasional starter for Borussia Dortmund. David Trezeguet, who helped France win the World Cup back in 1998, was perhaps the most famous pick-up. Mr. Trezeguet had been a prolific striker in a 10-year career at Juventus. But over the past two season injuries and poor form had limited him to just 15 league starts. With just one year left on his contract, H&#233;rcules summoned all its ingenuity, persuading Juventus to let it have the player for free. The fact that Mr. Trezeguet's wife is from Alicante also played a part in convincing him to spurn offers from bigger clubs. "I've seen a team with ambition who want to do things well," Mr. Trezeguet said of his new club. Dutch utility player Royston Drenthe was another such gamble. Real Madrid bought him for $19 million in the summer of 2007, shortly after he turned 20. Despite his unquestioned talent, Mr. Drenthe struggled on and off the pitch at the Santiago Bernab&#233;u and, this year, seemed unlikely to get much playing time. H&#233;rcules convinced Real to let it take the player on loan, the idea being that Mr. Drenthe might regain his form in Alicante and either return to Madrid a better player or, after a season on display, be easier to sell elsewhere. Cesena also did its bit of wheeling and dealing, adding no fewer than 18 players to its squad. Seven played against Milan. But everything was done with an eye towards finding value and keeping costs low. Of those 18 newcomers, 11 were loan signings, ensuring that, should Cesena be relegated, they'll simply disappear from the club's books. What's more, except for midfielder Lu&#237;s Jim&#233;nez, no Cesena player costs the club more than $480,000 a year in wages. (Some players on loan from bigger clubs earn more than that, but in those cases Cesena persuaded the loaning club to pick up the difference.) The club's total outlay on players this year&#8212;between net transfer spending and salaries&#8212;is less than $20 million, most of which will be covered by the increase in TV revenue now that Cesena is in the top flight. Saturday's upsets may have been just blips, but they do suggest that, with a bit of creativity and chutzpah, top-flight newcomers on shoestring budgets can compete with the big boys. And they can do it without finding themselves condemned to financial heartache in the future.
