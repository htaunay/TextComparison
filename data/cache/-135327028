 For a season and a half, Pep Guardiola was without fault, and during Barcelona’s 3-0 win on Sunday over Racing Santander, Barça gave no impression of a club that has had to admit a recent defeat, but with the Spanish champions’ sale of Zlatan Ibrahimovic to Milan, Barcelona has self-inflicted the most beguiling defeat of Guardiola’s short coaching career. Losing to Inter Milan in the Champions League semifinals or Sevilla in the Copa del Rey &#8211; sometimes, these type of results happen to coaches. But the inability &#8211; possible unwillingness &#8211; to incorporate one of the world’s best players is troublesome, particularly in light of Barcelona’s new and extravagant purchasing tendencies. If Guardiola was unable to make Ibrahimovic work, who&#8217;s to say purchases like that of Javier Mascherano’s will be more successful? 
 Those sentiments may seen too kind to Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who mass opinion has cast as a failure during his one season at Barcelona. Given he was sold at a large loss after one campaign, it&#8217;s difficult to be too positive about Ibra&#8217;s play. After all, the entity that had the greatest interest in his success, his club, saw fit to cut their losses. Where is there room to see Ibrahimovic as wronged, Guardiola and Barcelona as justified? 
 If you narrow a striker&#8217;s responsibilities to scoring goals, it&#8217;s difficult to mount an argument against Ibrahimovic that references real results more than hypotheticals. He scored 21 goals in 41 all-competition matches, adding ten assists during a season where a handful of his 41 appearances were limited by injuries. Barcelona failed to retain their European title or the Copa del Rey, but they were 12 points better in league and during the middle of the season achieved a form that surprassed the treble-winning heights of 2008-09. 
 Which is not to say Zlatan Ibrahimovic was responsible for that success. More readily, we can look at Lionel Messi&#8217;s continued improvement. We can look at Gerard Pique, Victor Valdes and Sergio Busquets&#8217; one year gains. There are many other reasons why the 2009-10 Barcelona team may have been better (if less award-winning) than their predecessor, facts which only cloud how we evaluate Ibrahimovic. Ibrahimovic&#8217;s numbers pailed in comparison to Lionel Messi and were a step-back from his performance for Internazionale, but that may be because of his performance or his role in the team. The seasons&#8217;s numbers hint at the latter. Regardless, Ibrahimovic failed to live up to the hypothetical goal rates envisioned with his move west. 
 There was, however, one memorable match where the numbers affirmed every criticism lobbed at the big Swede. The first leg of Barça&#8217;s Champions League semifinal against Inter, Ibrahimovic covered less distance than goalkeeper Victor Valdes, eventually being subbed-out by Guardiola in the 62nd minute. Ibrahimovic had been dealing with injuries coming into the match, but the lack of effort became glaring in Barcelona&#8217;s 3-1 loss at the San Siro. In the return leg, Ibrahimovic played only 63 minutes as Barcelona was eliminated by his former club. Even at the time, when he was subbed-off shortly after half time of that pivotal match, there was the feeling that Guardiola was calling an end to the short and frustrating Ibrahimovic era. 
 The Champions League semifinal was especially harmful to Ibrahimovic&#8217;s because of the presence of Samuel Eto&#8217;o. The Cameroonian striker went to Internazionale as makewieght in the Ibra transfer. With Inter, Eto&#8217;o won his second consectuive treble, though he had a more striking statistical drop-off than Ibrahimovic. With 16 goals in 47 matches, Eto&#8217;o&#8217;s output dropped by nearly 50 percent from the previous year, but since he was on a title-winning team, his failures were less scrutinized than Ibrahimovic&#8217;s. While there may be some hypocrasy in that, there&#8217;s also an element of fairness. In a team sport, you can always fall back upon the team&#8217;s results. Eto&#8217;o was winning trophies. 
 But Ibrahimovic&#8217;s real-time comparison to Samuel Eto&#8217;o was less important to Barça and Ibra. Ibrahimovic was competing against the 2008-09 version of Eto&#8217;o, the one that scored 36 goals in 58 all-competition appearances. Ibrahimovic dropped-off from that, and although that drop could be reasonably explained by a number of factors, that decrease was correlated with the Barça&#8217;s inability to retain Copa, inability to retain Champions League, and Ibra&#8217;s effort against Internazionale. All vectors showed Ibrahimovic was a failure. 
 The peculiar part about Ibra versus Eto&#8217;o: Ibrahimovic has had a better all-competitions goal scoring rate in each of the last three seasons. Even during Eto&#8217;o&#8217;s halycon days of 2008-09, Ibra outscored him (by rate), which only further clouds this confusing picture. Why wasn&#8217;t Ibrahimovic more successful in Barcelona? 
 At some point, we have to question Pep Guardiola and wonder if this wasn&#8217;t the first major failing of his Nou Camp tenure. Yes, he lost two competitions last year, but look at the history of these tournaments &#8211; the difficulty teams have repeating &#8211; and it&#8217;s only a relative failure to unsuccessfully defend your title. Losses happen to even the best teams, and they are not the only measure of a coach&#8217;s abilities. 
 How is a coach using the resources he&#8217;s given? This is why we instinctively felt Fulham&#8217;s Roy Hodgson, Sampdoria&#8217;s Luigi Del Neri, Braga&#8217;s Domingos Paciencia and Twente&#8217;s Steve McLaren did great jobs last season. Not only did their team&#8217;s results outstretch their expected finish, but individual performers where perfectly utilized. Bobby Zamora, Giampaolo Pazzini, Eduardo, and Bryan Ruiz all performed to the top of their range, and to Guardiola&#8217;s credit, there&#8217;s been little doubt that he&#8217;s gotten the most out of Messi, Xavi Hernandez, Pique, Valdes, and an array of other Blaugrana players. By this measure as well as trophies, Pep Guardiola is an elite coach. 
 But there are players who Guardiola has failed to utilize. Yaye Touré&#8217;s fall from first choice is still difficult to explain. He failed to get value from Dmytro Chigrynskiy and Rafa Marquez was not the same player under Guardiola that he was before. These failures make Guardiola no different than the Jose Mourinhos and Alex Fergusons of the world, both coaches having their failed projects, but it also opens up the possibility that Ibrahimovic may not have been the problem. When you look at how Ibrahimovic was handled in those Champions League semifinals and remember Samuel Eto&#8217;o missing chances at the same stage in the previous tournament, but see Ibrahimovic&#8217;s failure may have been influenced by coaching preference as much as performance. 
 Let&#8217;s go back to the Inter tie. When you are going up against a team intent on playing conservatively and on the counter and you take out your one target man, the player who can allow you to attack without exposing yourself to a counter, you&#8217;re exhibiting a preference destined for failure. Guardiola&#8217;s supporters can argue that Ibrahimovic had been ineffective when he was pulled against Internazionale, but Pep&#8217;s befuddling preference for Bojan Krkic and Jeffren Suarez at Barcelona&#8217;s most critical moment of the season shows that Ibrahimovic was not the lone actor in his downfall. 
 Ibrahimovic was one of the three most expensive transfers in history, and even as he moves back to Italy after his downfall in Barcelona, nobody is questioning his talent. They are questions of effort and attitude, health and fit, but nobody is convinced that this is not an elite player. Milan should be considered a title contender in Italy now that they&#8217;ve acquired him. Guardiola had him, failed to use him, and when Milan pay the €24 million fee next season to keep him, Guardiola&#8217;s preferences will have contributed to Barcelona losing close-to €50 million in the Ibrahimovic deal. And I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve heard, but Barcelona doesn&#8217;t have much money. 
 Why wasn&#8217;t Guardiola able to cultivate Ibrahimovic in the seven months between his acquisition and that Champions League semifinal? Why did Barça move away from Yaya Touré? Is it clear that Javier Mascherano will get time at Barcelona over Sergio Busquets, who Guardiola has already favored over Touré? And when Barcelona makes another major purchase that goes outside Guardiola&#8217;s comfort zone, will they be able to get on-the-field value for him? 
 None of this makes Guardiola a bad coach, but it does make him complicit in Ibrahimovic&#8217;s cast-off. Even considering last year&#8217;s failure to retain Champions League and Copa, this is Guardiola&#8217;s first major blemish as coach of the Blaugrana .
