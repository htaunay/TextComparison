Zlatan Ibrahimovic can play with Milan's Brazilian trio in the same team - agent Mino Raiola - Goal.com 
Zlatan Ibrahimovic' s agent Mino Raiola believes his client can form a deadly partnership with Milan 's trio of Brazilian attacking aces. A new fad has gripped the San Siro with fans and pundits hoping to see Ibrahimovic line up alongside Ronaldinho, Alexandre Pato and Robinho. Some critics have doubted all four can play together, considering the strain it would put on the midfield and defence, but Raiola has backed the plan. "Zlatan can play in a position up front and the four can play in many ways together," he told Antenna 3 . "But the decision lies with the coach [Massimiliano] Allegri." Raiola also explained the highs and lows of the transfer from Barcelona and he drew comparisons with Mario Balotelli's Manchester City move. "Transfers always involve optimism and pessimism, but you have to be cold to close the deals," he said. "I am happy that Balotelli went to England because he needed a different experience abroad. Mario is tranquil. He has to play and develop."ï»¿
