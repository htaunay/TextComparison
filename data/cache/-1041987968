Schalke sign Huntelaar and Jurado
 BERLIN (Reuters) - Schalke 04 struck late in the transfer window, signing Dutch striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar from Italian side AC Milan and Atletico Madrid attacking midfielder Jose Manuel Jurado on Tuesday. 

  The Dutch World Cup runner-up had been the subject of constant transfer speculation after struggling to nail down a starting place in his first season at the San Siro last term following a move from Real Madrid. 
 
  Jurado, 24, started his career at Real's youth teams, playing briefly with the seniors before joining Europa League holders Atletico in 2006. 
 
  The pair join former Real Madrid striker Raul who signed with last season's Bundesliga runners-up earlier in the transfer window. 

  "Atletico has reached an agreement for the transfer of Jurado. The deal was sealed in the night of August 30," Atletico said on their website (www.clubatleticodemadrid.com). 
 
  The transfer of Swedish striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic from Barcelona to Milan paved the way for Huntelaar's switch to Schalke. 

  "It is true I never wanted to leave Milan but that changed when Zlatan Ibrahimovic came from Barcelona," Huntelaar said on www.klaasjanhuntelaar.com. 
 
  "Klaas-Jan wants to continue his career at Schalke. Schalke and Milan have agreed on a transfer fee of about 13 million euros," he said. 
 
  Schalke, who are playing in the Champions League this season, have lost both their opening Bundesliga matches. 

  The 27-year-old Huntelaar played for four years at Ajax Amsterdam before moving in 2009 to Real, where he also failed to establish himself, and then to Milan. 

  "Negotiations were tougher than expected. I am happy to have Klaas-January He will help us," Schalke boss Magath told Bild newspaper early on Tuesday.
