AFP: Allegri dreams of Ibra-Ronaldinho-Pato
 ROME &#x2014; AC Milan coach Massimiliano Allegri said on Saturday that the acquisition of Zlatan Ibrahimovic would give him the best strike-force in Europe. Milan are in negotiations with Barcelona to bring the big Swede back to Italy, just a year after he left Milan's arch rivals Inter. And if they can complete the transfer, Allegri believes a trident of Ibrahimovic, Ronaldinho and Alexandre Pato would be the best in Europe. "Yes, I think it would be," he said. "And when you add (Marco) Borriello, (Filippo) Inzaghi and (Klaas-Jan) Huntelaar, who is still with us, they represent attacking resources that would make any coach in the world jealous." However, Allegri insisted that the whole Ibrahimovic affair would not distract his side's preparations for Sunday's Serie A opener against newly-promoted Lecce. "Right now the most important thing is the match against Lecce. With any luck we'll celebrate Ibrahimovic's arrival with a victory," he said before giving a message to his current forwards. "The other strikers shouldn't be worried, I have faith in them. Borriello had a great season (last season), there are many games and it's immpossible to always play with the same XI." However, Allegri did suggest that should Ibrahimovic arrive, Huntelaar would be likely to leave. "I haven't yet thought about Huntelaar. For now he's with us and Ibra isn't. I'll confront the problem when it arrives." Allegri has only two injury concerns for the visit of Lecce -- French midfielder Mathieu Flamini and veteran full-back Massimo Oddo. As for Lecce, coach Luigi De Canio inists they won't be changing their style to negate Milan's strengths. "We'll play as we always have, knowing that we're playing against a team with great players and great potential," he said.
