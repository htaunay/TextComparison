GF104, Geforce GTX 460 mobile to come this summer - Notebooks - Fudzilla 
Nvidia's new GPU codenamed GF104 is also finding its way to the latest notebooks. What we keep calling mainstream market, Nvidia calls performance, and the performance market is the top of the mainstream market anyway. 
 The Performance notebook market will definitely embrace GF104 chips. We are not sure if Nvidia decided to use the Geforce GTX 460M branding, but we believe it is very likely. Since the desktop version of GF104 comes on July 14th we would expect to see some notebooks based on the same chips shortly after. This of course depends on OEM refresh cycles, but since the back to school perid starts in late July or early August, we would expect to see some designs by that time. 
 Remember, the GF104 has a 25 percent lower TDP compared to the GF100 and when matched with Optimus, the GF104 might be a decent chip for the performance mobile market.
