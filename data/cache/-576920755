New Nvidia GF100 PCB shows up
Quite a few pictures of what appears to be a new reference Fermi PCB have showed up online, and according to all the details, this looks like the PCB for the "uncrippled" GF100 with full 512 CUDA cores and 64 ROPs. The best evidence are the two 8-pin PCI-Express connectors which should be enough for the power-hungry GF100. Pictures feature a watermark from AIB partner Little Tiger and in addition to two 8-pin PCI-Express connectors, you can also see a more powerful VRM with high-C surface-mount capacitors. The new card would most likely end up to be the Geforce GTX 485 and full specs include 512 CUDA cores, 64 ROPs, a slightly higher clock speeds set at 720MHz for the core and 1440MHz for Shaders, and the same 1536MB of GDDR5 memory paired up with a 384-bit memory interface and clocked at 924MHz. According to the reports, this one should show up during the fall 2010. You can find more here . Update : According to the comments made by macblastin down in our comments section, it looks like that this one is nothing more than a pumped-up version of the GTX 480 with a better VRM and more power. Nevertheless, it would be interesting to see how far will this one be able to overclock and how much power will it actually need.
