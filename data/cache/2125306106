GettyImages Robinho and Zlatan Ibrahimovic were AC Milan's marquee summer signings  Milan have snapped up Zlatan Ibrahimovic from Barcelona and Robinho from Manchester City over the last week, seemingly giving the Rossoneri a better chance of winning the Scudetto and ending Inter Milan's recent dominance. And Allegri, who only joined Milan over the summer, is very pleased with the new additions to his squad. "I am delighted with the arrival of Ibrahimovic,'' Allegri said. "I didn't expect an added reinforcement of the calibre of Robinho. It's a very nice present from Berlusconi and I thank him from the bottom of my heart.'' Having already overseen an impressive start to the Serie A campaign with a 4-0 triumph over Lecce last week, Allegri believes Milan are now better equipped to challenge on all fronts, including the Champions League. "We have a team of the top level even in Europe,'' said Allegri, who replaced Leonardo at the helm of the Rossoneri . "We must go all the way to the final at Wembley.''
