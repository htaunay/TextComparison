Politics, power and players: Berlusconi's AC Milan election engine By Greg Duke, CNN         STORY HIGHLIGHTS Robinho is the latest big-name player to be signed by Italian giants AC Milan The Brazilian striker joins Zlatan Ibrahimovic at the San Siro for this season The signings come as Silvio Berlusconi's popularity is on the wane in the opinion polls Some commentators believe the Milan owner uses the club to boost his political popularity  (CNN) -- When Robinho completed his dramatic deadline-day transfer from Manchester City to AC Milan last month, he became the latest in a long line of flamboyant big-name players to move to the San Siro. Most would agree the attacking prowess of the 26-year-old party-loving, Brazil striker would help bolster the attack of any team in the world, but it's his ability to help decide the future of Italian politics that was arguably just as attractive to his new employers. That is because club owner Silvio Berlusconi also happens to be the prime minister of Italy and -- according to leading commentators -- AC Milan's success has been inextricably linked to Berlusconi's rise to power. It could be just a coincidence of course, but Robinho's arrival, on the back of the purchase of Barcelona superstar striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic comes at an apposite time for the beleaguered statesman. The 73-year-old has the support of less than 30 percent of voters according to a recent poll for the newspaper La Repubblica -- following the defections of dozens of members of parliament in July and the departure of Gianfranco Fini -- a co-founder of Berlusconi's ruling &quot;People of Liberty,&quot; over policy disagreements. So could the capture of Robinho help shore up Italy's coalition government? There is no doubt that Berlusconi is a man who stirs the emotions of his compatriots in many different ways.
